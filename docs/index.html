<h1>Background</h1>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> This is a work in progress…</p>
<p>When we were researching solar panels for our house, we found lots of
websites describing the general economics of it, such as this helpful <a
href="https://ca.renogy.com/blog/what-is-the-average-solar-panels-roi-in-canada/">site</a>,
but surprisingly, I could not find any websites/blogs describing real
data from a household that had installed solar. What do the grid-energy
consumption data look like before and after solar installation? What are
the actual hourly / daily patterns of solar energy production and grid
energy consumption for a household?</p>
<p>To fill this gap, I’ve decided to share our own data!</p>
<div id="our-household" class="section level2">
<h2>Our household</h2>
<p>We are two adults, two teenagers, and a dog occupying a 1.5 storey,
1260 ft<span class="math inline">\(^{2}\)</span> house in downtown
Kelowna, British Columbia. Yeah, it’s a bit tight…</p>
<p>The house was build in the 1940s, so it’s as inefficient as you might
expect. For instance, it still has wood chip insulation in most exterior
walls. However, with the help of extremely handy members of the extended
family, we’ve made some improvements that have definitely improved its
efficiency.</p>
<p>We had new roof shingles and a ridge vent installed in December 2020
(leaking forced this), and I subsequently installed proper insulation
and venting in the knee-walls next to the dormer bedrooms. That made a
huge difference in the dormer rooms… much less hot in the summer, and
much warmer in the winter.</p>
<p>In Spring 2022, we added a one-bedroom dwelling (500 ft<span
class="math inline">\(^{2}\)</span>) to the west side of the house, and
decided this was an opportune time to install solar panels. The addition
is very efficient; it has two small heat-pump units, one in the living
room and one in the bedroom. It also has an electric fireplace for extra
heat when needed (rarely).</p>
<p>Like many folks, we hope to replace our current vehicle with an EV
some time in the next four or five years, so having our own energy
source would help when the time comes.</p>
<p>We did not buy batteries for storing the solar power. One day
maybe…</p>
<p>In November 2022 we replaced the remaining old, large windows on the
main floor of our house. The house now feels much more air-tight! That’s
the last of the home improvements for a while…</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="household-energy-consumption" class="section level2">
<h2>Household energy consumption</h2>
<p>Our typical annual household energy consumption was about 10,000 kWh.
We’ll show the data for this in a bit…</p>
<p>We heat our house with an efficient gas furnace, so the laundry drier
and electric stove/oven are probably the biggest consumers of
electricity throughout the year. In the summer, air conditioning draws
more. Of course we use A/C mostly when solar production should be
greatest…</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="the-solar-array" class="section level2">
<h2>The solar array</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2022 we had an array of thirty-six 360W panels
(model: Longi LR4-60HPB-360M) installed on our south-facing roof. The
entire array size is 12.96kW.</p>
<p>Our solar system was supplied and installed by <a
href="https://www.oksolarhomes.com">Okanagan Solar</a>. Their team was
amazing to work with.</p>
<p>This system is large for our current needs (about 10,000 kWh / yr),
but with the new one-bedroom addition, and hopefully an EV in the next
few years, the 12.96kW solar system should be ideal.</p>
<p>The layout of the array on our roof is shown in the following images
(provided by Okanagan Solar as part of their assessment):</p>
<p><img src="images/overhead_panels.png" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p><img src="images/angle_panels.png" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p>Note that the flatter part of the roof extends over our patio.</p>
<p>An added benefit of covering the south-facing roof with solar panels:
the kids’ dormer bedrooms are even cooler in the summer, because the
panels are intercepting the energy before they hit the roof tiles.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="electricity-supplier" class="section level2">
<h2>Electricity supplier</h2>
<p>Fortis BC is our electricity provider, and like most places in North
America, we don’t have a choice about who we purchase electricity
from.</p>
<p>As described at their <a
href="https://www.fortisbc.com/about-us/corporate-information/regulatory-affairs/our-electricity-utility/electric-bcuc-submissions/electricity-rates">website</a>,
Fortis bills customers bi-monthly, and uses a tiered charging system,
such that the first 1600kWh are currently charged at $0.12365/kWh, and
$0.13713 for any kWh beyond that. They also charge a flat service /
delivery fee of about $40 for the two months.</p>
<p>Be sure to consult their website to keep track of any updates to
rates.</p>
<p><strong>Net metering</strong></p>
<p>Fortis BC has a <a
href="https://www.fortisbc.com/services/electricity-services/generating-your-own-electricity/net-metering">net
metering program</a>, in which any energy produced by the solar array
that is not used immediately on site is put back into the grid, and
Fortis keeps track of this and “banks” the kWh on the account. In
theory, Fortis then uses these banked amounts against future bills.
However, I have yet to receive a bills that correctly reflect this, and
their <a
href="https://www.fortisbc.com/services/electricity-services/generating-your-own-electricity/net-metering/understanding-your-net-metering-electricity-bill#item5">website
that explains a net-metering bill</a> shows a new bill format that looks
nothing like mine… I’ll update this website as soon as this is figured
out.</p>
<p>If we happen to have anything left in our “bank” at the end of March,
then our account will get credited at a rate equivalent to what Fortis
pays their providers. This should be close to $0.10 / kWh. Given our
cloudy winters, it’s unlikely we’ll have anything left in the bank in
March.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="power-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Power up!</h2>
<p>We officially started producing solar power on July 8, 2022, and net
metering started on July 15, 2022. So, between July 8 and July 15, the
grid benefited from our solar output!</p>

<h1>The Data!</h1>
<div id="solar-energy-production-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Solar energy production data</h2>
<p>I have another <a
href="https://github.com/pitherj/home_solar/blob/main/scripts/wrangle_solar_data.Rmd">script</a>
that imports the raw solar energy data files, downloaded from the <a
href="https://www.apsystemsema.com">AP Systems website</a>, and wrangles
them into an appropriate (tidy) format.</p>
<p>Here’s what the first few rows of the resulting data table looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2,695 × 4
##    date                day         hour    kWh
##    &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;

##  8 2022-07-08 11:00:00 2022-07-08    11  9.59 
##  9 2022-07-08 12:00:00 2022-07-08    12 10.8  
## 10 2022-07-08 13:00:00 2022-07-08    13 10.7  
## # … with 2,685 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Let’s visualize the data to check for errors:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/firstplot-1.png" alt="Figure 1: Hourly energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Hourly energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array,
starting July 8, 2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>Ah, we see a strange data point… investigating, this is a morning
when I took the datalogger offline. The system automatically sums up the
total kWh produced over the time period that it was offline.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 4
##   date                day         hour   kWh
##   &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2022-08-30 14:00:00 2022-08-30    14  40.0</code></pre>
<p>So for that day (August 30, 2022), we won’t be able to use the hourly
data for analysis.</p>
<p>But we can sum up the total kWh by day, and plot:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/secondplot-1.png" alt="Figure 2: Daily energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022." width="672" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>And FYI, Kelowna got an early winter… beginning of November saw more
than 30cm of snow fall, and it STAYED! Which meant that the solar panels
were covered for the better part of 5 days. I then cleared off a few of
them (the steeper angled ones), and we saw a wee bit of sun. However,
from November through February each year, Kelowna tends to be very grey…
the clouds settle in the valley and just stay here. But it’s often sunny
at higher elevation.</p>
<p>The sun started peaking out more in mid-January in the end, so we’ve
had more energy production than anticipated!</p>

<div id="grid-energy-consumption-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Grid energy consumption data</h2>
<p>Another <a
href="https://github.com/pitherj/home_solar/blob/main/scripts/wrangle_electricity_data.Rmd">script</a>
imports the raw Fortis energy consumption data for our account,
downloaded from the FortisBC <a href="www.fortisbc.com">website</a>, and
wrangles them into an appropriate (tidy) format.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I could only get historical consumption data back to
June 1st, 2022.</p>
<p>Despite valiant efforts by a helpful Fortis customer service
employee, Fortis was unable to provide me historical consumption data in
any format that was readily usable. They’re working on improving
this…</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE Jan 2023</strong> I now have hourly data going back to
January 1, 2019!</p>
<p>So we’ll append the historical data to the more recent data, then
have a look.</p>
<p>Here’s what the first few rows of the June 1st onward data look
like:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 35,323 × 4
##    day         hour kw_returned kw_consumed

## # … with 35,313 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Let’s visualize the data to check for errors, first limiting the date
to June 1 2022 and after:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/thirdplot-1.png" alt="Figure 3: Hourly energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June 1, 2022." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Hourly energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June
1, 2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>hmm, that’s messy… but it does show that once the solar system was
online (July 8), and during daytimes up to the end of October, we
typically drew directly from solar, thus zero kWh consumed from the
grid.</p>
<p>Let’s sum up the total kWh consumed by day, and visualize:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/fourthplot-1.png" alt="Figure 4: Daily energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June 1, 2022." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4: Daily energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June 1,
2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the low consumption in June is due to data gaps, which are
also a mystery to Fortis.</p>
<p>The substantial increase in energy consumption in November was from
the combination of early winter/snow/cloud in Kelowna, and 3 weeks with
our wonderfully handy in-laws living with us to do final upgrades at our
house: replacing 4 windows and a door in the main house. So, over the
first 3 weeks of November, we were using more electricity than usual,
and we had little sun for solar energy production.</p>
<p>Let’s combine the data into one plot.</p>

<p>Yikes! Despite not being rented out much, the new short-term rental
clearly increased our electricity consumption during the cold snap at
the end of December 2022, relative to the preceding 3 winters. However,
we were still trying to figure out the optimal way to maintain a low
temperature (10 degrees) while the suite was unoccupied. The heat pumps
work very hard to keep the place warm when it’s -10 or lower
outside.</p>
<p>We’ll have to see how we do next winter, and depending on

that 62 days, and we delivered 2674 kWh back to the grid over that same
period.</p>
<p>Using the data downloaded from our solar system and the hourly
consumption data downloaded directly from the Fortis website, we get the
following numbers:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_consumed total_returned
##            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1           887.          2703.</code></pre>
<p>So, a little off, but not too bad.</p>
<p>Now let’s check Sept 28 to Nov 28, which shows 1929 kWh consumed, and
921 kWh returned.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_consumed total_returned
##            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          1975.           922.</code></pre>
<p>Not far off again!</p>
<p>Now let’s check Nov 28 to Jan 28, which were extremely cloudy months…
it shows 2712 kWh consumed, and 123 kWh returned.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_consumed total_returned
##            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          2712.           123.</code></pre>
<p>OK, so now we have the data matching exactly, as we’d expect!</p>
<p>So let’s do it for the entire period now (through Jan 28):</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   total_consumed total_returned
##            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          5682.          4474.</code></pre>
<p>That’s pretty amazing… we’re through the most cloudy period of the
year (Nov/Dec/Jan), and we produced almost 79% of our energy needs.</p>
