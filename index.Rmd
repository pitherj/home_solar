# Background

This site provides analyses of solar energy production and household consumption data for our 1.5 storey home in downtown Kelowna, British Columbia.

## The solar array

In the summer of 2022 we had an array of thirty-six 360W panels (model: Longi LR4-60HPB-360M) installed on our south-facing roof. The entire array size is 12.96kW.

The layout of how the array is deployed on our roof is shown in the following images:

## Electricity supplier

Fortis BC is our electricity provider, and like most places in North America, we don't have a choice about who we purchase electricity from.

As described at their [website](https://www.fortisbc.com/about-us/corporate-information/regulatory-affairs/our-electricity-utility/electric-bcuc-submissions/electricity-rates), Fortis bills customers bi-monthly, and uses a tiered charging system, such that the first 1600kWh are charged at $0.12365/kWh, and $0.13713 for any kWh beyond that. They also charge a flat service fee of 

**Net metering** 

Fortis BC has a [net metering program](https://www.fortisbc.com/services/electricity-services/generating-your-own-electricity/net-metering), in which any energy produced by the solar array that is not used immediately on site is put back into the grid.  The kicker is that Fortis only pays out $0.05/kWh for energy supplied to the grid. This is half of what BC Hydro pays out. So if you're wishing to calculate what your return on investment would be for solar, be sure to think about this, and have a look at the [map of BC](https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/safety/bchydro-service-area-map.pdf) showing the distribution of electricity providers.  

## Household electricity demands

Our typical annual household energy consumption was about 10,000 kWh. We'll show the data for this in a bit...

Air conditioning is probably our biggest single electricity hog, but we tend to only use it on the hottest and sunniest of days. This is of course when solar production is highest also.  We therefore expect to save a considerable amount of money by powering our A/C using the solar energy, at least during the daytime hours. 

# Let's see the data!

## Solar energy data

I have another script that imports the raw solar energy data files, downloaded from the [AP Systems website](https://www.apsystemsema.com), and wrangles them into a proper format.

```{r echo = FALSE}
solar.data <- readr::read_csv("./outdata/solar_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Here's what the first few rows of the resulting data table looks like:

```{r}
solar.data
```

Let's visualize the data to check for errors:

```{r firstplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Hourly energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022."}
solar.data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = kWh)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_bw()
```

Ah, we see a strange data point... investigating, this is a morning when I took the datalogger offline. The system automatically sums up the total kWh produced over the time period that it was offline.

```{r echo = FALSE}
solar.data %>%
  filter(kWh > 30)
```

So for that day (August 30, 2022), we won't be able to use the hourly data for analysis.

But we can sum up the total kWh by day, and plot:

```{r secondplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Daily energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022."}
solar.data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(kWh)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = total)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kWh") +
  ylim(0, 90) +
  theme_bw()
```
