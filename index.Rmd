# Background

**NOTE** This is a work in progress...

This site provides analyses of solar energy production and household consumption data for our 1.5 storey, 1260 ft^{2} home in downtown Kelowna, British Columbia.  

Our system was supplied and installed by [Okanagan Solar](https://www.oksolarhomes.com).  Their team was amazing to work with.

## The solar array

In the summer of 2022 we had an array of thirty-six 360W panels (model: Longi LR4-60HPB-360M) installed on our south-facing roof. The entire array size is 12.96kW.

The layout of how the array is deployed on our roof is shown in the following images (provided by Okanagan Solar as part of their assessment):  

![](./images/overhead_panels.png){width=25%}  

![](./images/angle_panels.png){width=25%}  

Note that the flatter part of the roof extends over our patio.  

An added benefit of covering the south-facing roof with solar panels: the kids' dormer bedrooms don't heat up anywhere near as much in the summer, because the panels are intercepting the energy before they hit the roof tiles.

## Electricity supplier

Fortis BC is our electricity provider, and like most places in North America, we don't have a choice about who we purchase electricity from.

As described at their [website](https://www.fortisbc.com/about-us/corporate-information/regulatory-affairs/our-electricity-utility/electric-bcuc-submissions/electricity-rates), Fortis bills customers bi-monthly, and uses a tiered charging system, such that the first 1600kWh are charged at $0.12365/kWh, and $0.13713 for any kWh beyond that. They also charge a flat service fee of 

**Net metering** 

Fortis BC has a [net metering program](https://www.fortisbc.com/services/electricity-services/generating-your-own-electricity/net-metering), in which any energy produced by the solar array that is not used immediately on site is put back into the grid.  The kicker is that Fortis only pays out $0.05/kWh for energy supplied to the grid. This is half of what BC Hydro pays out. So if you're wishing to calculate what your return on investment would be for solar, be sure to think about this, and have a look at the [map of BC](https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/safety/bchydro-service-area-map.pdf) showing the distribution of electricity providers.

## Start dates

We officially started producing solar power on July 8, 2022, and net metering started on July 15, 2022.  So, between July 8 and July 15, Fortis did not record any solar energy being supplied to the grid.  

* * *

## Household electricity demands

Our typical annual household energy consumption was about 10,000 kWh. We'll show the data for this in a bit...

Air conditioning is probably our biggest single electricity hog, but we tend to only use it on the hottest and sunniest of days. This is of course when solar production is highest also.  We therefore expect to save a considerable amount of money by powering our A/C using the solar energy, at least during the daytime hours.

# Let's see the data!

## Solar energy production data

I have another [script](https://github.com/pitherj/home_solar/blob/main/scripts/wrangle_solar_data.Rmd) that imports the raw solar energy data files, downloaded from the [AP Systems website](https://www.apsystemsema.com), and wrangles them into an appropriate (tidy) format.

```{r echo = FALSE}
solar.data <- readr::read_csv("./outdata/solar_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Here's what the first few rows of the resulting data table looks like:

```{r}
solar.data
```

Let's visualize the data to check for errors:

```{r firstplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Hourly energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022."}
solar.data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = kWh)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_bw()
```

Ah, we see a strange data point... investigating, this is a morning when I took the datalogger offline. The system automatically sums up the total kWh produced over the time period that it was offline.

```{r echo = FALSE}
solar.data %>%
  filter(kWh > 30)
```

So for that day (August 30, 2022), we won't be able to use the hourly data for analysis.

But we can sum up the total kWh by day, and plot:

```{r secondplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Daily energy output (kWh) for the 36-panel solar array, starting July 8, 2022."}
solar.data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(kWh)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = total)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kWh") +
  ylim(0, 90) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Grid energy consumption data

I have another [script](https://github.com/pitherj/home_solar/blob/main/scripts/wrangle_fortis_data.Rmd) that imports the raw solar energy data files, downloaded from the [AP Systems website](https://www.apsystemsema.com), and wrangles them into an appropriate (tidy) format.

```{r echo = FALSE}
consumption.data <- readr::read_csv("./outdata/fortis_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Strangely, I could only get historical consumption data back to June 1st, 2022....

Here's what the first few rows of the resulting data table looks like:

```{r}
consumption.data
```

Let's visualize the data to check for errors:

```{r thirdplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 3: Hourly energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June 1, 2022."}

consumption.data %>%
  filter(!is.na(kw_consumed)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = kw_consumed)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_bw()
```

hmm, that doesn't look great...  but it does show that during daytimes we typically drew directly from solar, thus zero kWh consumed from the grid.

Let's sum up the total kWh consumed by day, and plot:

```{r fourthplot, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 4: Daily energy consumption (kWh) for our house, starting June 1, 2022."}

consumption.data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(total_consumed = sum(kw_consumed)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = total_consumed)) +
  geom_line(colour = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kWh") +
  theme_bw()
```

Note that the low consumption data in June is due to data gaps...

Let's combine the data into one plot.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
all_data <- full_join(consumption.data, solar.data, by = c("day", "hour"))
```

```{r fifthplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 5: Daily energy consumption (red) and solar production (blue) for our house (kWh), starting June 1, 2022."}

all_data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(total_consumed = sum(kw_consumed, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_produced = sum(kWh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = day, y = total_consumed), colour = "firebrick") +
  geom_point(aes(x = day, y = total_consumed), shape = 1, colour = "firebrick") +
  geom_line(aes(x = day, y = total_produced), colour = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(x = day, y = total_produced), colour = "blue", shape = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kWh") +
  theme_bw()
```

* * *

## Tally all the data

From July 8th to October 21 (last day of data for now), let's calculate how much: 

* gross solar energy we've produced  
* total solar energy returned to grid
* total energy consumed from grid

```{r totnums}
all_data %>%
  filter(day >= ymd("2022-07-08")) %>%
  summarise(total_solar_produced = sum(kWh, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_fortis_consumed  = sum(kw_consumed, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_solar_returned = sum(kw_returned, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Do the same for when we started net metering (July 15)

```{r tots}
all_data %>%
  filter(day >= ymd("2022-07-15")) %>%
  summarise(total_solar_produced = sum(kWh, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_fortis_consumed  = sum(kw_consumed, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_solar_returned = sum(kw_returned, na.rm = TRUE))
```

In theory, the difference between the total solar produced and total energy returned to the grid should equal the total energy consumed from the grid.  But this isn't the case... 

* * *

## Check bill numbers

Let's check the data reported on the bill for July 28th through September 28, 2022.

It shows 875 kWh consumed from the grid over that 62 days, and 2674 kWh delivered back to the grid over that same period.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
consumption.data %>%
  filter(day >= ymd("2022-07-28") & day <= ymd("2022-09-28")) %>%
  summarise(total_consumed  = sum(kw_consumed, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_returned = sum(kw_returned, na.rm = TRUE))
```

So, a little off.

Unfortunately, Fortis has no data for our account from before June 1st, and for much of June, the data are full of gaps.  I'll be contacting them...
