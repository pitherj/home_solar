Unfortunately there are no publicly available solar radiation data in Kelowna.  For now, we'll download what we can get.

## Import weather data

First let's find the nearest station

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
stations_dl()
kelowna.stations <- stations_search("KELOWNA", interval = "hour")
kelowna.stations
```

So the UBCO station is the best one, so let's get the ID of that station

```{r}
station_id <- stations_search("UBCO", interval = "hour")$station_id
```

Download hourly data

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
kelowna <- weather_dl(station_ids = station_id, start = "2022-07-08", end = "2023-04-14")
```

export data

```{r}
readr::write_csv(kelowna, here::here("outdata", "weather_data.csv"))
```
